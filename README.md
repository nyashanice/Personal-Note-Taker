# Personal-Note-Taker

## Description

The personal Note Taker app is a handy application that allows users to keep track of notes and see them all in one area. I think this app is useful because you can plainly see past notes instead of having to click on and expand them to know what it's about.

While building this application, I learned how to use and implement Express.



## Usage

To use the application, you can type in a note title and any supporting text on the screen and click on the save button in the top right corner. This will then populate your note on the left hand side of the screen in a column.
